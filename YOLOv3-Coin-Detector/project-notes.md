## Overview

The goal of this project is to get acquainted with deep learning object detection by training a YOLOv3
network implemented in PyTorch.

Instead of pulling public datasets from such as VOC or COCO to train the YOLOv3 network, I will be making 
an attempt to construct one myself. To start things off simple, I have decided to build a 4-class coin 
dataset (Singapore currency).
